## Hello! Thanks for stopping by.

A little about me - 

Meticulous Data Scientist accomplished in compiling, transforming, and analyzing complex information through software. Demonstrated success in identifying relationships and building solutions to diverse problems. Passionate about asking the right questions and owning problems end-to-end.

Areas of specific interest to me are climate change, mycology, health + wellness, and behavior change. I love to chat about this and more, so feel free to connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lara-strachan/)!

### My Projects:
- [WiDS Datathon 2023](https://github.com/lara-es/WiDS_Datathon) (expected completion in March 2023)
  - This yearâ€™s datathon, organized by the WiDS Worldwide team at Stanford University, Harvard University IACS, Arthur, and the WiDS Datathon Committee, will focus on longer-term weather forecasting to help communities adapt to extreme weather events caused by climate change.
- [Satellite Imagery Analysis](https://github.com/lara-es/Capstone)
  - Identify areas in Colorado that would be most valuable to protect based on patterns of human pressures and biodiversity. Using GIS tools such as rasterio, xarray, ArcGIS, and EO Browser, created a k-Means model to classify land use, & an ArcGIS map to visually interpret findings.
- [Climate Change and Coffee Production](https://github.com/lara-es/Project4)
  - Explore whether climate change has an impact on coffee production and retail price. Collaborated with 3 peers to design project, collect data, and implement models to gain insight and tell a compelling story.
- [Reddit NLP Comment Engagement Analysis](https://github.com/lara-es/reddit_nlp_classification)
  - Collect data from Reddit then build a classification model to predict whether a post would receive more than the median comments. Leveraged both text and qualitative features via ColumnTransformer to create a Logistic Regression pipeline.
